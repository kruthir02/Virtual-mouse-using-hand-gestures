# Virtual-mouse-using-hand-gestures

This project proposes a way to control the position of the cursor with the bare hands without using any electronic device. While the operations like clicking and dragging of objects will be performed with different hand gestures. The proposed system will only require a webcam as an input device. The software’s that will be required to implement the proposed system are OpenCV and python. The output of the camera will be displayed on the system’s screen so that it can be further calibrated by the user. The python dependencies that will be used for implementing this system are NumPy, math, wx and mouse.
