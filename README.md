# Virtual-mouse-using-hand-gestures

This project proposes a way to control the position of the cursor with the bare hands without using any electronic device. While the operations like clicking and dragging of objects will be performed with different hand gestures. The proposed system will only require a webcam as an input device. The software’s that will be required to implement the proposed system are OpenCV and python. The output of the camera will be displayed on the system’s screen so that it can be further calibrated by the user. The python dependencies that will be used for implementing this system are NumPy, math, wx and mouse. 


# Problem statement
The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for the persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst of the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gesture and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera.


# Result
The proposed model is so accurate that it can also be used in real-world applications. For example, it can be used to reduce the spread of COVID19 and eliminate the need for wearable devices. 

This system is mainly aimed to reduce the use of hardware components attached with the computer.
 
Recognition and the interpretation of sign language is one of the major issues for the communication with dumb and deaf people. This project is pretty much expressive such that the dumb and deaf people could understand it.

Not only did this project show the different gesture operations that could be done by the users but it also demonstrated the potential in simplifying user interactions with personal computers and hardware systems.
